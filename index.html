Zero Day Engineering
<h1>Training Classes</h1>
<h2>Hypervisor Exploitation One:<br>System Internals & Vulnerabilities</h2>
Learn to discover, analyze, and prototype security vulnerabilities in arbitrary virtualization software through a generalized and systematical perspective, based on effective abstractions, concrete implementation details, inspection of known bugs, and cross-domain insights of the instructor. <a href="training/HVInt.html">More details</a>.

- 26-28th November, 2020: ONLINE (3 days, 09-17 UTC)
Price: â‚¬2900,- 


<h2>iBootcamp</h2>
iBootcamp is an experimental, online-only, multistaged training course on iOS internals, vulnerability discovery and exploit development, created for beginners. <a href="https://ibootcamp.training">More details</a>.


<h1>Research</h1>
<h2>System Internals</h2>
<a href="https://re.alisa.sh/notes/Hyper-V-LIS.html">Hyper-V Internals and LIS</a>
Microsoft Hyper-V relies on two core mechanisms for inter-partition and hypervisor communications: the hypercall interface and the VMBUS. This note constitutes a fairly complete and technically concise overview of an implementation of both at the core level. 

<a href="https://re.alisa.sh/notes/iBoot-heap-internals.html">iBoot Heap Internals</a>
This research note provides a basic technical outline of the Apple bootchain's heap internals, key algorithms, and security mitigations. 

<a href="https://re.alisa.sh/notes/iBoot-address-space.html">iBoot Address Space</a>
This Research Note documents a generalized perspective on Apple devices' bootchain memory layout  across all stages of the boot process, and specifically relevant to SecuROM and iBoot. As a case study, a detailed memory map of iPhone 5 during boot is presented.

<h2>Proof of Concepts</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/badd1e/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2018-6981_VMWare_ESXi">CVE-2018-6981: VMWare Workstation and ESXi vmxnet3 Uninitialized Variable Vulnerability</a>
Proof-of-concept testcase for one of the bugs leveraged at GeekPwn2018 to achieve a full VM escape from VMWare ESXi, <a href="https://twitter.com/alisaesage/status/1146059432255582211">recreated</a> from the respective binary security patch. Technically it's a patch for Linux vmxnet3 kernel mode driver implementation.

<a href="https://github.com/badd1e/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2019-0717_Hyper-V">CVE-2019-0717: Hyper-V Virtual Network Switch (vmswitch.sys) VmsMpCommonPvtSetRequestCommon Out of Bounds Read DoS Vulnerability</a>
Proof-of-concept testcase for a Tier 1 (host partition kernel) vulnerability in Microsoft Hyper-V. This is a patch for rndis_filter.c Linux kernel mode driver, on of the Hyper-V paravirtualization drivers built-in in the Linux kernel.

<a href="https://github.com/badd1e/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2018-XXXX_VirtualBox">CVE-2018-XXXX: VirtualBox 3D Virtualization Memory Corruption Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (multiple)</a>
In 2018 I found a few dozens of bugs in the Oracle VirtualBox (old) 3D acceleration implementation, based on Chromium. This repo contains a subset of analysis reports sent to the Zero Day Initiative.

<h1>About Us</h1>
0days.engineer is an educational project focused on advanced vulnerability discovery and exploit development for modern and popular software systems. 

We maintain a continuous internal research process aiming at strategic zero-day vulnerability discovery in many modern software systems; participate in official security bounty programs of major software vendors; share selected research and analysis notes with the community; and develop commercial training classes based on the privately and independently obtained deep technical knowledge. 

Feel free to contact us if you want to book a public or private class, purchase e-learning materials based on our past trainings, suggest a collab project, or host our training classes at your venue.
